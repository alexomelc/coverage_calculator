### Description

This is a modular insurance product. People can choose from four modules. Each module has a different selectable coverage and a different mathematical risk.
These are the modules:
Bike (Coverage 0-3k, Risk 30%)
Jewelry (Coverage 500-10k, Risk 5%) Electronics (Coverage 500-6k, Risk 35%) Sports Equipment (Coverage 0-20k, Risk 30%)
The user should be able to select the coverage for each module and see the calculated price. The price of the tariff, which is the individual configuration for each customer, should be calculated based on the risk: [price] = [coverage]*[risk]
Task
Design and implement a solution using React that would allow:
Select the coverage for the module and see the calculated price Add/remove multiple modules to the shopping card
See the items in the shopping card and see their total price
Bonus: save basket state on page reload
